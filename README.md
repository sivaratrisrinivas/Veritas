# Veritas: The Trust Engine for AI

Veritas is a proof-of-concept application that enhances Exa's AI search capabilities by introducing a "Veracity Score"—a dynamic, real-time trustworthiness rating for web search results.

This project was built to explore a contrarian idea: the next frontier for AI search isn't just about finding information, but about validating it. Veritas demonstrates how Exa's powerful API can be used not just as a tool, but as a partner in building more intelligent, reliable, and trustworthy AI systems.

## The Problem: The AI's "Trust Blindness"

Imagine you hire a brilliant, super-fast research assistant. You ask them to write a report on a complex topic, like the financial implications of a new technology.

The assistant instantly reads millions of articles, blogs, and studies online. In one minute, they come back with a stack of papers. The problem is, the stack contains a mix of everything:

- A peer-reviewed study from a top university
- A well-researched article from a reputable financial newspaper  
- A speculative blog post from an anonymous writer
- An article secretly sponsored by a company with a biased agenda

Your research assistant, for all its speed, is "trust-blind." It hands you the whole messy pile and treats every source as equally valid. Now, the most difficult and time-consuming work falls to you: sorting the treasure from the trash. If you accidentally rely on the junk information, your entire report could be flawed.

This is the exact challenge developers face when building AI agents. An AI using a standard search API is incredibly fast at finding information, but it has no built-in wisdom to judge the quality or reliability of that information.

## The Solution: The "Veracity Score"

Veritas solves this problem by giving the AI research assistant a "trustworthiness checklist." It's a layer of intelligence that sits on top of Exa's search, analyzing and scoring results before they are presented to the end user or another AI system.

The result is a single, intuitive **Veracity Score from 0 to 100** for each search result. Instead of a messy pile of links, the user gets an organized, pre-vetted list where a high score indicates a source is likely to be authoritative and well-supported, and a low score signals that it should be approached with caution.

This transforms the AI from a simple information retriever into a wise and reliable research partner.

## How It Works: A Look Under the Hood

Veritas uses a sophisticated hybrid strategy that combines the intelligence of dynamic AI-driven rules with the reliability of a static safety net.

Here's the step-by-step process when you ask Veritas a question:

### 1. Topic Detection
First, Veritas asks the Exa /answer API to analyze your query and determine its primary topic (e.g., "Health," "Technology," "Finance").

### 2. Dynamic Rule Generation
Next, it prompts the Exa AI again with a more complex question: "For the topic of 'Technology', what are the most authoritative and trustworthy websites?" This allows the AI itself to define the rules of what makes a good source for any given topic.

### 3. Resilient Fallback
Sometimes, an AI's answer might be too generic or unhelpful. If the dynamic rule generation fails, Veritas doesn't crash. It intelligently falls back to a curated, hardcoded list of trusted sources for that topic, ensuring the system is always reliable.

### 4. Intelligent Search & Scoring
Veritas then performs the main search on Exa, but with a crucial enhancement. It modifies the query to tell Exa to prioritize results from the trusted domains it just identified.

### 5. Final Analysis
For each result returned, Veritas calculates the final Veracity Score based on a weighted average of:

- **Authority Score**: Does the result come from one of the trusted domains?
- **Citation Score**: Does the article link out to other globally reputable sources (like news agencies or scientific journals)?

This multi-step process results in a final list of search results, each enriched with a meaningful score that reflects its likely quality and trustworthiness.

## Significance for Exa.ai

Veritas is more than just a technical demo; it's a strategic proposal for the evolution of Exa's product.

### Moving Up the Value Chain
It shows how Exa can move beyond being a data provider (giving links) and become an intelligence provider (giving validated, trustworthy information). This is a significantly higher-value position in the AI ecosystem.

### Solving a Critical Developer Pain Point
Every developer building a serious AI agent will eventually face the problem of information quality. By offering a built-in "veracity" feature, Exa can solve this problem for them, making its API stickier, more valuable, and harder to replace.

### A Leader in Responsible AI
In an era of rampant misinformation, providing tools to verify information is not just a feature; it's a responsibility. This positions Exa as a forward-thinking, ethical leader in the AI space.

### Unlocking New High-Value Use Cases
A trust layer opens the door to new enterprise applications that are currently too risky to automate, such as financial market analysis, legal research, and automated scientific reporting. It expands Exa's potential market significantly.

## Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get Veritas running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip for package installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd Veritas
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

This keeps your project's dependencies isolated.

```bash
# Create the environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate it (on macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Activate it (on Windows)
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all the necessary Python packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: You will need to create a requirements.txt file by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`*

### 4. Configure Your API Key

Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project folder. This file will hold your secret API key. Add the following line to it:

```
EXA_API_KEY='your_real_api_key_from_exa_goes_here'
```

### 5. Run the Application

Start the Flask development server.

```bash
python app.py
```
